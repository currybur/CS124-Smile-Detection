# Smile Detection
**glance at Python and sklearn, step into programming**
***
### Introduction
This is the final project of Introduction to Computation(CS124, given by Prof. Fan Cheng), with team member Xie Dongwei.  
Use genki4k and SVM to train a smile detecting model. The project does help me to get familiar with programming in python. And we managed to implement a simple real-time smile detecting program.
### How to use this repo
requirements
* numpy
* opencv
* scikit-learn

The real time detector should be able to work instantly. The ```main.py``` contains feature extracting and trarining, which needs genki4k dataset.
